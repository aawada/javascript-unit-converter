#javascript-unit-converter

This is a unit converter between Knots and MPH. This project utilized javascript to be able to convert those units. The index file with partial code was provided from my professor in my Intro to Internet Computing Class. It was modified to convert to different units. The design layout was a bootstrap package from W3Layouts. I have included their license that came with the design package.
